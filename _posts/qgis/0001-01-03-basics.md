In this tutorial, we will use two geographical layers downloadable from the [NaturalEarth database online](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/) and already available in the */dss_course_dataset* folder:

    /dss_course_dataset/shp/natural_earth

Files to be used are:

    ne_10m_admin_0_countries.shp (world countries)
    ne_10m_populated_places_simple.shp (world main cities)

### 1. Opening, selecting and closing vector layers

See video tutorial either on your local copy or on YouTube [QGIS-Open Vector Layers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpQ_ALWKpJM&feature=player_embedded)

### 2. Understand relationship between Map and Attribute table through features selection
In that tutorial we will use the following layer:
 
    ne_10m_admin_0_countries.shp (world countries)

See video tutorial either on your local copy or on YouTube [QGIS-Map view vs Attribute table](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS_TkdDK0d4&feature=player_detailpage)

### 3. Navigating the map
In that tutorial we will use the following layer:
 
    ne_10m_admin_0_countries.shp (world countries)

See video tutorial either on your local copy or on YouTube [QGIS-Map navigation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS_TkdDK0d4&feature=player_detailpage)

### 4. Styling layers through the 'Properties Dialog box'
Files to be used are:

    ne_10m_admin_0_countries.shp (world countries)
    ne_10m_populated_places_simple.shp (world main cities)
