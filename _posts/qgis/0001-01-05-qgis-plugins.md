### 1. Installing QGIS extensions, modules

As Open-Source software, QGIS users and developers familiar with programming can develop and provide the communty with additionnal features as extension modules (plugin). Plugins are stored in repositories (servers hosting QGIS modules contributors).

In this tutorial, we will see how to install and activate new plugins (here, **'Statist'** that allows to plot values histogram).

File used in that tutorial:

    /dss_course_dataset/qgis/1-basics/ne_10m_populated_places_simple.shp (world main cities)

See video tutorial either on your local copy or on YouTube [QGIS-Installing new plugins](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkQXuj-ISYw&feature=player_detailpage)

* **TableManager** (Manages attribute table structure)
* **GdalTools** (Advanced tools for raster layer analysis and management)
