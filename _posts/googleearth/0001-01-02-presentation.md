Google Earth is a software released in 2005. GoogleEarth popularized the concept and use of Geographical Information Systems. It is not a fully fledged GIS but it provides very interesting features such as vector layer creation, measuring distances, styling data, visualization of Digital Elevation Model, visualization of 3D profiles, ... But GoogleEarth is more than a software, it is an access platform to  millions of very high resolution satellite images, pictures of every single streets in some cities, 3D modeling of building,...

Additionnaly, GoogleEarth development has generalized the use of a format of geographical data named **'kml'**. This open format allows to encode geographical features location and style in an efficient way.

In these series of tutorials we will see:

1. How to create a KML file with the GoogleEarth interface
2. How to create a KML file from scratch with a text editor
3. How to create a KML file with "shp2kml" software 
4. How to create or edit KML file with Python programming language -ADVANCED-

More important, we will see the strenghs and weaknesses of GoogleEarth and how to use it in a complementary way to TileMill.
