In that tutorial we will see how to create distance buffers around a specific set of features. For instance, to draw a 200m buffer distance from a road, talweg, radionuclides concentration peaks, ...

File to be used in that tutorial is:

    /dss_course_dataset/qgis/6-vector-spatial-analysis/road_eldorado_900913.shp


Note that if you want to specify the distance in meters, you will need to choose a map projection for your layer (here EPSG: 900913).

See video tutorial either on your local copy or on YouTube [QGIS-Creating Buffers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=ehj_LIG0-Mc)
