The study of colours is complex and different points of view provide a theoretical framework:

* the **physical** theory: type of light, electromagnetic waves of definite lengths, ...
* the **chemical** theory: type and properties of dyes (colorantes), with their production, ...
* the **physiological** theory of color: studies the process of color perception by the eye, ...
* the **psychological** theory of color: studies colors as a subjective experience, sensations and ideas evoked by colors.

A good introduction to these topics is:

The purpose of this page is not to dive into these theories but only to provide the basics knowledge required to specify colors. There are many different reds, blues, ... we need an accurate system allowing to specify it.

###6. Encoding

Each primary colour is encoded between **0** and **255**

Each color being a composition of Red, Green, Blue, a color can be specified as (125,122,12) for instance in decimal.

[Color are frequently specified as Hexadecimal as well.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal)
