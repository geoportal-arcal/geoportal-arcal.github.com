Mapping involves determing the geographic locations of features on the earth, transforming these locations into positions on a flat map through use of map projection.

The **first step** is to choose a model of reference for the shape of the earth.

### 1. Modeling the shape of the earth


Until the late 1600s, the earth was thought to be perfectly spherical in shape. The change came in 1670 with Isaac Newton who proposed that a consequence of its theory of gravity would be a slight bulging of the earth at the equator due the greater centrifugal force generated by the earth's rotation.

From 1800 to the present, at least 20 determinations of the earth's flattening and radii have been made: Everest (1830), ..., Bessel (1841), Clarke (1866), WGS72 (1972), GRS80 (1980), WGS84 (1984).

WGS84 and WGS72 determined from satellite orbital data, are considered more accurate than the earlier ground measurements determinations.

The shape of the earth is approximatively an ellipsoid with the following dimensions:
* semi-major axis: 6378 km
* semi-minor axis: 6356 km

The earth is a very smooth geometrical figure. Most of the earth's surface appears rugged and rough to us, but even the highest peaks and deepest ocean trenches are barely noticeable irregularities. Imagine for instance the earth reduced to 1m in diameter, Mt Everest would be but a 70 mm.  

#### 1.1 Geoid
Due to irregularities of earth's gravity field, earth's shape is not perfectly an ellipsoid as shown below (note that variations are exaggerated in this illustration for educational purpose). This shape is called 'Geoid'.

One way to define a simple mathematical model of such complex shape is to define local ellipsoids best fitting the local shape of the earth as shown below. As a result many local ellipsoids exists according to the location of interest.

Hopefully, the WGS84 global ellipsoid though not giving the best fit for a particular part of earth is today considered as a standard. **In our case WGS84 will be systematically used**. 

To summarize, the surface of the earth can be modelled by:
* **authalic spheres** (spheres whose surface is equal to the surface of the ellipsoid modelling the earth shape)
* **local ellipsoids**
* **global ellipsoids**  

Once a model of earth's shape has been defined, the **second step** is to define a coordinate reference system.
 
### 2. Geographic coordinates
The geographical coordinate system employing latitude and longitude can be traced to the 2nd century B.C. The geographical coordinate system is the primary locational reference system for the earth. It was devised to make possible a unique statement of location for each earth feature.

The north and south poles, where the axis of rotation intersects the earth's surface, are the starting points on which to base the system. Specyfing a locationon the earth requires determining **latitude**, the north-south angular distance from the equator, and **longitude**, the east-west angular distance from a prime meridian. All points on the earth having the same latitude form a line called a **parallel**; all points of the same longitude form a **meridian** line.

The **equator**, the line on the earth formed by points halfway between the two poles, is the natural starting place for **latitude**. Latitude ranges pole to pole from 90°N to 90°S or +90° to -90° (when using a digital databases).

 Longitude, our weast-west position on the earth, is associated with an infinite set of meridians, arranged perpandicularly to the parallels. Unlike the equator in the latitude system, no meridian has a natural basis for being the starting line from which to measure east-west positions. During the 19th century, many nations accepted the **meridian of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich** near London, England, as 0° (it was officialy agreed in 1884).
Longitude ranges from 180°W to 180°E of the prime meridian (from -180° to +180° for digital databases).

#### 2.1 Geographic coordinates units and conversions
To specify longitude and latitude coordinates, three numeral systems can be used:
1. **sexagesimal (base 60)** also known as Degree, Minutes, seconds
2. **decimal (base 10)**
3. a mix of decimal and sexagesimal also known as Degree, Decimal Minutes 

For instance Irapuato (lon/lat) geographical coordinates can be specified as:
1. lon: **E 101°21'16.1856''** / lat: **N 20°40'43.194''** 
2. lon: **-101.354496** / lat: **+20.678665**
3. lon: **E 101°21.26976'** / lat: **N 20°40.7199'**

The conversion process is elementary as explained below. Let's consider you want to convert coordinates from system 1 to system 2:
* considering that 1° = 60' = 3600''
* decimal longitude = 101 + (21/60) + (16.1856/3600) = 101.354496 (then -101.354496 to take into account that Irapuato is East from Greenwich)
* and decimal latidue = 20 +(40/60) + (43.194/3600) = 20.678665 (the +20.678665 as North pole). 

Thus, it is easy to create your own converter using Excel for instance (look at the example provided into course DropBox account). Additionnaly many website proposes such tools online. For instance [boulter.com](http://boulter.com/gps), ... 




### 3. Properties of the graticule 

### 4. Map projections
One simple way of mapping the earth without distortion is to map it on a globe. When we do so all we change is the size (scale). On the other hand, globes have many practical disadvantages: 
* expensive to make
* difficult to reproduce
* cumbersome to handle
* awkward to store
* difficult to measure and draw on
* less than half of the globe is visible at any one time

Projecting earth surface on a flat surface eliminates these drawbacks. Nevertheless developping a sphere onto a plane introduces distortions (modification of angles or/and area -see below-). 

#### 4.1 Projections on a flat surface
It is not possible to flatten a sphere onto a plane without stretching it (think about the situation where you want to flatten an orange skin onto a flat surface. The orange skin will be necessary torn).
