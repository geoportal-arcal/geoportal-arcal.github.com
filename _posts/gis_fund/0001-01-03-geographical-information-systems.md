A Geographical Information System (GIS) is the marriage of a drawing software like (Illustrator/Inkscape, Photoshop/Gimp) and database software like (Access, Orcale, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, ...).

A GIS allows among others:

* to open/create geographical data (data with geographical reference)
* to process data geometry (points, lines, polygons): add, remove, clean, ...
* to process data attributes (tabular data associated with a polygon for instance -country name, population, area, ...- similar as an Excel file)
* to process raster data (satellite imagery, digital elevation models, ...)
* to overlay several geographical layers on a same view (roads, rivers, landuse, administrative boundaries, ...)

* to analyse data by querying the dataset and answering questions like:

   * What is the shortest path to reach city A from city B?
   * What is the area of lake B included in county C?
   * etc ...

* to create maps
* to create thematic analysis. For instance drawing circle whose diameter is proportional to population of cities.
* to access external/online dataset
* and many other intersting things
