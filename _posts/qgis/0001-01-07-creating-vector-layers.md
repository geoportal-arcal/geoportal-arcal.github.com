### 1. Creating a vector layer through selection
We want in that tutorial create a new vector layer from an existing layer by selecting a subset of features.
We will create here a "Latin America" vector layer from an existing vector layer showing world countries.

File to be used in that tutorial is:

    /dss_course_dataset/shp/natural_earth/ne_10m_admin_0_countries.shp (world countries)

See video tutorial either on your local copy or on YouTube [QGIS-Vector Layer Creation Through Selection](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhSmy5IcxOw&feature=player_detailpage) 

### 2. Creating a vector layer from a ".csv" file embedding geographic coordinates
