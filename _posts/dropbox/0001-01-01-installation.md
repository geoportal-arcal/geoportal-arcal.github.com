### Introduction
[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/home) is a file hosting service allowing to:
1. store your files online
2. synchronize your files between different computers (laptop, desktop for instance)
3. share specific folders with other persons and work collaboratively
4. Access your files (through a specific URL) from any website.

To take a dropbox tour click [here](https://www.dropbox.com/tour).

A Dropbox account has been created for ARCAL RLA 5/051 Decision Support System project (Login and password will/have been sent to you). 
This account will offer several interesting opportunities: 

1. share a common folder name 'arcal_dss' where each participant country would share relevant datasets or files:
   * measurements files
   * pictures of studies sites
   * general documentation on your intitiative

2. share tutorials (additionnaly to those provided in this website), tools, resources, ...

3. make specific datasets publicly available allowing to download it directly from the Decisions Support System (see DSS related tutorials)
